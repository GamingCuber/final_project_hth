## What is this?
This will be an analysis of the relationship between music and mental health through a dataset by Catherine Rasgaitis.

## Why did I choose this?
I'm someone who has enjoyed listening to music ever since I was really young. Music is something that as cheesy as it sounds, has been with me my entire life. Along with just the enjoyment of listening, I'll often put on music to help me relax or calm down, or to simply get lost in it. This dataset would show me a more quantified way of expressing the effects music has one people.
